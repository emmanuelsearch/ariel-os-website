Ariel OS is an operating system for secure, memory-safe, low-power Internet of Things (IoT). Ariel OS is implemented entirely in Rust. Ariel OS supports the main microcontroller hardware architectures (Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP) popular boards from vendors such as Nordic, ST, Espressif and Raspberry Pi. Integrating the best of the available embedded Rust ecosystem, Ariel OS strives to provides a seamless, batteries-included experience for microcontroller firmware development. Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os).
