Ariel OS is an operating system for secure, memory-safe, low-power Internet of Things (IoT) implemented entirely in Rust. It supports the main microcontroller hardware architectures (Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP) and popular boards from vendors such as Nordic, ST, Espressif and Raspberry Pi. Ariel OS is built on top of Embassy and the embedded-hal traits for hardware abstraction, adds various OS functionalities and integrate the best of the available embedded Rust ecosystem to provide a seamless, batteries-included experience for microcontroller firmware development. Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os).
